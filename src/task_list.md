# Agent Development Task List

## High Priority Tasks

1. **Implement Action Execution Functionality** - Allow the agent to execute actions from the plan with proper confirmation and error handling.
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Status: Partially implemented
   - Notes: Currently requires manual confirmation for each action

2. **Add Task Dependency Tracking** - Enhance the dependency tracking system to better manage task execution order.
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Status: Basic implementation exists
   - Notes: Need to improve validation and handling of circular dependencies

3. **Add Ability for Agent to Modify Its Own Plan** - Allow the agent to update its plan based on new information or execution results.
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Status: Basic framework exists
   - Notes: Need to implement proper validation and conflict resolution

4. **Show Progress as Tasks are Completed** - Improve progress tracking and visualization.
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Status: Basic implementation exists
   - Notes: Need to make progress updates more granular and accurate

5. **Add Confirmation for Each Action Before Execution** - Ensure user has control over what actions are executed.
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Status: Implemented
   - Notes: Consider adding batch confirmation option for multiple related actions

## Medium Priority Tasks

6. **Fix Reasoning Token Display** - Improve how reasoning tokens are displayed during streaming.
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Status: Partially working
   - Notes: Need to ensure consistent formatting and avoid line breaks between tokens

7. **Improve Error Handling** - Add better error handling throughout the codebase.
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Status: Basic implementation
   - Notes: Focus on graceful recovery from API failures and invalid XML

8. **Add Task Status Visualization** - Enhance the visual representation of task status and dependencies.
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Status: Basic implementation exists
   - Notes: Consider adding graphical visualization options

9. **Implement Parallel Task Execution** - Allow multiple non-dependent tasks to be executed in parallel.
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Status: Not started
   - Notes: Will require significant refactoring of execution logic

10. **Add Plan Validation** - Validate plan structure and dependencies before execution.
    - Priority: MEDIUM
    - Status: Basic implementation exists
    - Notes: Need to add more comprehensive validation rules

## Low Priority Tasks

11. **Add Export/Import Functionality** - Allow plans to be exported and imported in different formats.
    - Priority: LOW
    - Status: Not started
    - Notes: Consider supporting JSON, YAML, and Markdown formats

12. **Add Command History** - Implement command history in the interface.
    - Priority: LOW
    - Status: Not started
    - Notes: Allow users to recall and edit previous commands

13. **Add Undo Functionality** - Allow users to undo actions.
    - Priority: LOW
    - Status: Not started
    - Notes: Implement a simple undo stack for actions

14. **Add File Backup Before Modifications** - Create backups of files before modifying them.
    - Priority: LOW
    - Status: Not started
    - Notes: Implement a simple backup system with restore capability

15. **Add Template Support** - Allow users to create and use templates for common tasks.
    - Priority: LOW
    - Status: Not started
    - Notes: Implement a template system for plans and actions
