- dopamin
    - let it output dopamin with every new xml message depending on how good it did judging by the last observation
    - i might want to use that to optimize the text in the prompts
    - maybe we can let the model make suggestions itself on how to improve the prompt e.g. by adding tipps and information

- no actions visible under the model suggests the following actions
- don't think we need an action xml tag, all of those are kind of actions
