    - Output dopamine with every new XML message depending on performance quality
    - Use dopamine levels to optimize prompts over time
    - Allow the model to make suggestions on how to improve prompts
    - Analyze user feedback to determine appropriate dopamine levels

- no actions visible under the model suggests the following actions
- don't think we need an action xml tag, all of those are kind of actions
